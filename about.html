      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>I am a passionate and forward-thinking Computer Science Engineer with a relentless drive to use technology as a force for good. Blending creativity with logic, I thrive at the intersection of innovation and impact. From an early age, I’ve been captivated by the endless possibilities of the digital world—how lines of code can become powerful tools to solve real-world problems and how a simple idea can evolve into something transformative.

As a developer and tech enthusiast, I specialize in crafting elegant solutions to complex challenges. My expertise spans software development, data structures and algorithms, systems architecture, and emerging technologies. I believe that every line of code written with intention has the potential to make a difference—not just in applications, but in lives. Whether I'm debugging a stubborn loop, building intuitive user interfaces, or architecting robust backend systems, I bring precision, creativity, and a strong work ethic to every project.

Beyond engineering, I'm deeply invested in the human side of technology. I believe that innovation must be inclusive, ethical, and aligned with a greater purpose. I'm committed to leveraging my skills to contribute to a more connected, equitable, and sustainable world—whether through open-source collaboration, community tech initiatives, or future-forward projects with social impact.

When I’m not immersed in code, you’ll likely find me indulging in my other passions—gaming, media, and creative storytelling. I see gaming as more than entertainment; it's a dynamic realm where narrative, design, and interactivity collide to create rich, immersive experiences. It inspires how I approach user experience and problem-solving in my tech work. My love for media—film, animation, digital art—further fuels my appreciation for aesthetics and innovation in both form and function.

Driven by curiosity and powered by caffeine (and maybe a few epic gaming soundtracks), I’m always exploring new languages, frameworks, and ideas. Whether collaborating with like-minded changemakers or quietly grinding through solo projects, I’m on a mission to build tools, systems, and stories that matter.</p>
